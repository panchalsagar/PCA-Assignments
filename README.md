# PCA-Assignments

Performed PCA on wine dataset and apply clustering algorithms

1. As our problem is suggesting to use first 3 principal components for further computation, Extracting the three features from PCA_dataset

2. Performing Heirarchical Agglomerative Clustering

3. Performing K-MEANS Clustering

4. Preparing Actual Vs. Predicted Clusering Data
 
Problem Statement

Perform Principal component analysis and perform clustering using first

3 principal component scores (both heirarchial and k mean clustering(scree plot or elbow curve) and obtain optimum number of clusters and check whether we have obtained same number of clusters with the original data (class column we have ignored at the begining who shows it has 3 clusters)df
